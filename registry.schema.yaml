      k6 Extension Registry.

      The k6 extension registry contains the most important properties of registered extensions.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: "#/$defs/extension"
  extension:
    type: object
    description: |
      Properties of the registered k6 extension.

      Only those properties of the extensions are registered, which either cannot be detected automatically, or delegation to the extension is not allowed.

      Properties that are available using the repository manager API are intentionally not registered.

      The string like properties that are included in the generated Grafana documentation are intentionally not accessed via the API of the repository manager. It is not allowed to inject arbitrary text into the Grafana documentation site without approval. Therefore, these properties are registered (eg `description`)
    properties:
      module:
        type: string
        description: |
          The extension's go module path.

          This is the unique identifier of the extension.
          More info about module paths: https://go.dev/ref/mod#module-path

          The extension has no name property, the module path or part of it can be used as the extension name. For example, using the first two elements of the module path after the host name, the name `grafana/xk6-dashboard` can be formed from the module path `github.com/grafana/xk6-dashboard`. This is typically the repository owner name and the repository name in the repository manager.

          The extension has no URL property, a URL can be created from the module path that refers to the extension within the repository manager.
        examples:
          - github.com/grafana/xk6-dashboard
          - github.com/szkiba/xk6-top
      imports:
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
          pattern: "^k6$|^k6/x/"
        description: |
          List of JavaScript import paths registered by the extension.

          Currently, paths must start with the prefix `k6/x/`.

          The extensions used by k6 scripts are automatically detected based on the values specified here, therefore it is important that the values used here are consistent with the values registered by the extension at runtime.
        examples:
          - ["k6/x/csv", "k6/x/csv/stream"]
          - ["k6/x/toml"]

          The extensions used by k6 scripts are automatically detected based on the values specified here, therefore it is important that the values used here are consistent with the values registered by the extension at runtime.
        examples:
          - ["dashboard"]

          Brief description of the extension.
        examples:
          - This is a very cool extension, it displays the message 'Hello World!'
      versions:
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
          pattern: "^v\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+.*$"
        description: |
          List of supported versions.

          Versions are tags whose format meets the requirements of semantic versioning. Version tags often start with the letter `v`, which is not part of the semantic version.
        examples:
          - ["v0.1.0", "v0.2.0", "v0.2.1"]
      cgo:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
          Flag indicating the need for cgo.

          The `cgo` property value `true` indicates that cgo must be enabled to build the extension.
      constraints:
        type: string
        pattern: "[vxX*|,&\\^0-9.+-><=, ~]+"
        default: ""
        description: |
          Version constraints.

          Version constraints are primarily used to filter automatically detected versions.
          It can also be used to filter the versions property imported from the origin registry.
        examples:
          - [">=v0.4.0", ">v0.50.0"]
      repo:
        $ref: "#/$defs/repository"
        description: |
          Repository metadata.

          Metadata provided by the extension's git repository manager. Repository metadata are not registered, they are queried at runtime using the repository manager API.
      tier:
        $ref: "#/$defs/tier"
        default: "community"
        description: |
          Maintainer of the extension.

          Possible values:

            - official: Extensions owned, maintained, and designated by Grafana as "official"
            - community: Extensions are listed on the Registry by individual maintainers, groups of maintainers, or other members of the k6 community.

          Extensions owned by the `grafana` GitHub organization are not officially supported by Grafana by default.
          There are several k6 extensions owned by the `grafana` GitHub organization, which were created for experimental or example purposes only.
          The `official` tier value is needed so that officially supported extensions can be distinguished from them.

          If it is missing from the registry source, it will be set with the default "community" value during generation.
        examples:
          - "community"
          - "official"

        default: 0
        description: |
          Last modification timestamp.

          The timestamp property contains the timestamp of the last modification of the repository in UNIX time format (the number of non-leap seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1st January 1970).
          Its value depends on the repository manager, in the case of GitHub it contains the time of the last push operation, in the case of GitLab the time of the last repository activity.

  tier:
    type: string
    enum: ["official", "community"]
    description: |
      Maintainer of the extension.

      Extensions can be classified according to who maintains the extension.
      This usually also specifies who the user can get support from.

      Possible values:

        - official: Extensions owned, maintained, and designated by Grafana as "official"
        - community: Extensions are listed on the Registry by individual maintainers, groups of maintainers, or other members of the k6 community.

      Extensions owned by the `grafana` GitHub organization are not officially supported by Grafana by default.
      There are several k6 extensions owned by the `grafana` GitHub organization, which were created for experimental or example purposes only.
      The `official` tier value is needed so that officially supported extensions can be distinguished from them.

      If it is missing from the registry source, it will be set with the default `community` value during generation.
    examples:
      - "community"
      - "official"
