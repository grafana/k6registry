      k6 Extension Registry.

      The k6 extension registry contains the most important properties of registered extensions.

    additionalProperties: false
  extension:
    type: object
    description: |
      Properties of the registered k6 extension.

      Only those properties of the extensions are registered, which either cannot be detected automatically, or delegation to the extension is not allowed.

      Properties that are available using the repository manager API are intentionally not registered.

      The string like properties that are included in the generated Grafana documentation are intentionally not accessed via the API of the repository manager. It is not allowed to inject arbitrary text into the Grafana documentation site without approval. Therefore, these properties are registered (eg `description`)
    properties:
      module:
        type: string
        description: |
          The extension's go module path.

          This is the unique identifier of the extension.
          More info about module paths: https://go.dev/ref/mod#module-path

          The extension has no name property, the module path or part of it can be used as the extension name. For example, using the first two elements of the module path after the host name, the name `grafana/xk6-dashboard` can be formed from the module path `github.com/grafana/xk6-dashboard`. This is typically the repository owner name and the repository name in the repository manager.

          The extension has no URL property, a URL can be created from the module path that refers to the extension within the repository manager.
        examples:
          - github.com/grafana/xk6-dashboard
          - github.com/szkiba/xk6-top
      imports:
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
          pattern: "^k6/x/"
        description: |
          List of JavaScript import paths registered by the extension.

          Currently, paths must start with the prefix `k6/x/`.

          The extensions used by k6 scripts are automatically detected based on the values specified here, therefore it is important that the values used here are consistent with the values registered by the extension at runtime.
        examples:
          - ["k6/x/csv", "k6/x/csv/stream"]
          - ["k6/x/toml"]

          The extensions used by k6 scripts are automatically detected based on the values specified here, therefore it is important that the values used here are consistent with the values registered by the extension at runtime.

      repo:
        $ref: "#/$defs/repository"
        description: |
          Repository metadata.

          Metadata provided by the extension's git repository manager. Repository metadata are not registered, they are queried at runtime using the repository manager API.
      tier:
        $ref: "#/$defs/tier"
        default: "community"
        description: |
          Maintainer of the extension.

          Possible values:

            - official: Extensions owned, maintained, and designated by Grafana as "official"
            - partner: Extensions written, maintained, validated, and published by third-party companies against their own projects.
            - community: Extensions are listed on the Registry by individual maintainers, groups of maintainers, or other members of the k6 community.

          Extensions owned by the `grafana` GitHub organization are not officially supported by Grafana by default.
          There are several k6 extensions owned by the `grafana` GitHub organization, which were created for experimental or example purposes only.
          The `official` tier value is needed so that officially supported extensions can be distinguished from them.

          If it is missing from the registry source, it will be set with the default "community" value during generation.

      products:
        type: array
        items:
          $ref: "#/$defs/product"
        description: |
          Products in which the extension can be used.

          Some extensions are not available in all k6 products.
          This may be for a technological or business reason, or the functionality of the extension may not make sense in the given product.

          Possible values:

            - oss: Extensions are available in k6 OSS
            - cloud: Extensions are available in Grafana Cloud k6

          If the property is missing or empty in the source of the registry, it means that the extension is only available in the k6 OSS product.
          In this case, the registry will be filled in accordingly during generation.

      There are several k6 extensions owned by the `grafana` GitHub organization, which were created for experimental or example purposes only.
      The `official` tier value is needed so that officially supported extensions can be distinguished from them.

      If it is missing from the registry source, it will be set with the default "community" value during generation.
