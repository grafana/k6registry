k6registry `v0.1.33` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This is an internal maintenance release.
- Update k6lint to v0.2.0
- Compliance check TTL

## k6lint v0.2.0

k6lint v0.2.0 includes two new checkers:

- build checker
- smoke checker

### build checker

The check is successful if the extension can be built with the latest k6 release.

### smoke checker

The check is successful if there is a smoke test script and it runs successfully with the k6 built with the extension.

Obviously, a prerequisite for a successful run is that the build checker runs successfully, otherwise k6 cannot be built with the extension.

The smoke test script file is searched for in the root of the repository and in the `test`,`tests`,`examples` directories. The name of the smoke test script is one of the following:
  - `smoke.js`
  - `smoke.ts`
  - `smoke.test.js`
  - `smoke.test.ts`

## Compliance check TTL

The result of the compliance check was previously cached until the source code of the given extension was changed.

The result of the build check depends not only on the source code of the given extension, but also on the latest k6 release. This made it necessary to introduce a TTL (time to live) value in the compliance check cache.
