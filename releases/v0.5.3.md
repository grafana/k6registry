k6registry `v0.5.3`

This release adds support for k6 subcommand type extensions and includes dependency updates.

## What's Changed

### Features

#### Subcommand Type Extensions Support

Starting from k6 v1.5.0, k6 supports "subcommand" type extensions that add custom subcommands to the k6 CLI. These extensions can be invoked using `k6 x NAME`, where NAME is the registered subcommand name.

This release adds a new `subcommands` property to the registry schema to properly catalog these extensions:

```yaml
- module: github.com/example/xk6-example
  description: Example extension with subcommands
  subcommands:
    - example
    - demo
```

The `subcommands` property:
- Is an array of strings containing registered subcommand names
- Supports extensions that register multiple subcommands
- Enables better discoverability and documentation of extension capabilities
