k6registry `v0.1.11` is here 🎉!

This is an internal maintenance release.

- Categories support: added `categories` array property to extensions. Categories can be predefined string values.
- Rename `product` property to `products`: the `product` property is an array, so the name should be plural (`products`).
- Force the `k6/x/` path prefix in the import path.
